## Developing Environment

The development environment is same as the install one in the [README Getting started section](README.md#getting-started).

You will just have to create branch based on your changes. For the branch name, see the [Branch Naming](#branch-naming) section bellow.

<!-- ## Arborescence

These are the directories that we actively using in the development:

| Directory | Description |
| --------: | :---------- |
| [gitpy/](gitpy/) | Contains the \_\_main\_\_ file of GitPy |
| [gitpy/commands](gitpy/commands/) | Contains the operations of all CLI commands of the tool |
| [gitpy/configs](gitpy/configs/) | Contains the configuration files of the tool. The languages used for the configuration files is Python3 and Yaml |
| [gitpy/core](gitpy/core/) | Contains the core files of the tool. Like the CLI arguments and parsing file |
| [gitpy/manuals](gitpy/manuals/) | Contains manpage of the tool (page that you can have by running `man gitpy`) |
| [gitpy/tools](gitpy/tools/) | Contains third party utilities to improve GitPy. If you have a new feature that require a specific third party package/tool version, you can add it here |
| [gitpy/utils](gitpy/utils/) | Contains utilities of the tool (home made, not third party) |

> [!NOTE]  
> If your changes require a new directory, you have to inform us in the issue you opened and we will tell you if it's okay or not. -->

## Naming Conventions

### Branch Naming

For the branch naming, we using the [GitFlow workflow][gitflow_url] branch naming rules. Here is the branch naming convention:

| Branch name | Description |
| ----------: | :---------- |
| `master` | The main branch. It's the branch that's MUST BE ALWAY STABLE. This branch should also always contain the latest stable release of the project |
| `develop` | For working in progress for future releases. It will also have `-dev`, `-alpha` tags in it for release a beta version of the program |
| `feature/<scope>` | For new features are created and will be merged into the `develop` branch |
| `fix/<scope>` | For fixing a small bug that are not critical to fix it and will be merged into the `develop` branch |
| `hotfix/<scope>` | For quickly fixing critical issues in production code and will be merged into the `master` and `develop` branches |
| `release/<version>` | For preparing a new production release (not a dev or other, **a stable one**) and will be merged into the `master` and `develop` branches |
| `docs/<scope>` | For documentation changes and will be merged into the `develop` branch |
| `perf/<scope>` | For performance improvements and will be merged into the `develop` branch |
| `refactor/<scope>` | For refactoring the code and will be merged into the `develop` branch |
| `ci/<scope>` | For changes to the CI configuration and will be merged into the `develop` branch |

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use a different prefix, you just have to tell us in the issue you opened and we will tell you if it's okay or not.

### Commit Message Formatting

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **description**. 

> This principe came from the [Conventional Commits][conventional_commits_url] convention.

Here is the commit message convention format:

```
<type>[(optional scope)]: <description>
<BLANK LINE>
[optional body]
<BLANK LINE>
[optional footer(s)]
```

- The **optional scope** is a phrase describing a section of the codebase enclosed in parenthesis, e.g., "docs(CONTRIBUTING)".

- The **description** is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., "docs(CONTRIBUTING): Add commit message format section".

- The **optional body** is a longer description of the code changes. It can be several sentences long.

- The **optional footer** is a place to reference GitHub issues or other PRs that this commit closes.

#### Type

The type must be one of the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---: | :---------- |
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug Fix |
| `chore` | Used for changes that don't affect the codebase or the user-facing part of the application |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. It's used to clean up the code and make it more readable or easier to maintain |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance |
| `ci` | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |
| `nic` | For "Not In Changelog", used when the commit doesn't have to be in the changelog (because it generated based on the commit type of `git log`). Can be used when, for example, you already push something and you see after that you forgot to remove some bad typo |

> [!NOTE]
> And also here, if you want to use a different type, you just have to tell us in the issue you opened and we will tell you if it's okay or not.

### Version numbering

Gitpy use a tree part versioning system separated by dots to represent the major, minor, and patch version numbers. Major version number indicates a significant change or backward-incompatible change API (if an API will be implemented in the future). Minor version number indicates new features and others small changes that are backward-compatible with previous release. Patch version numbers indicate bug fixes to the previous feature or patch version.
> This principe came from the [Semantic Versioning][semantic_versioning_url] convention.

Production releases use the plain version numbers:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
0.1.0
...
...
1.0.0
...
1.1.0
1.4.0
2.0.1
2.3.0
...
```

The initial production release in a MAJOR.MINOR series (MAJOR.MINOR.0) is known as a feature release, which is the only type of release that can introduce new features. Any following production releases within the same MAJOR.MINOR series are restricted to containing only bug fixes.

Development releases are labeled by appending `-dev` to the entire version numbers, followed by the dev. release number:

```
1.0.0-dev1
1.0.2-dev1
1.2.0-dev1
1.2.0-dev2
...
```

Beta-test releases are labeled by appending `-beta` to the entire version numbers, followed by the beta release number:

```
1.0.0-beta1
1.0.2-beta1
1.2.0-beta1
1.2.0-beta2
...
```

Release candidate releases are labeled by appending `-rc` to the entire version numbers, followed by the release candidate number:

```
1.0.0-rc1
1.0.2-rc1
1.2.0-rc1
1.2.0-rc2
...
```

> [!NOTE]  
> A production release will not always have a dev or beta release before the final one. It can be directly a RC or a stable/prod release.

## Coding Guidelines

### Source Files

The source files name should consist of lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, dash ('-'), underscore ('_') and dot ('.'). to be sure that the files are compatible with different filesystems.

The top of each source file should contain a header that give information about the source file (name, create/update date, small description), copyright, and license.

The file name must clearly describe the file's content and should not include any spaces.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Filename: <name>
# Created: <date> | <time>
# Updated: <date> | <time>
#
# Description: <description>
#
# Copyright Â© 2024 by dedroot and GitPy Development team
#
# Licensed under GNU GPL-3.0 only. See the file "LICENSE" for more information.
```

> [!NOTE]  
> the `<date>` and `<time>` must be in the following format: `DD.MM.YYYY` and `HH:MM` (24h format).

### Source style

GitPy source files are formatted via the [Black][black_url] and the [Isort][isort_url] Python3 formatter together. These two tools are very useful to keep the code clean and readable. If you use [VScode][vscode_url] or [VScode Insider][vscode-insider_url], you can install the Isort and Black extensions with the following commands:

1. First you need to install Black and Isort on you machine. To do that, you can using [pipx][pipx_url] (see if your system package manager have it):

    ```shell
    pipx install isort black
    ```

2. If you don't have [pipx][pipx_url], then run the following command:

    - If you are on a Debian based distro:

        ```shell
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx
        ```

    - If you are on a Arch based distro:

        ```shell
        sudo pacman -Syy python-pipx
        ```

3. Next, open your VScode IDE (stable or Insider) and open the Quick Open dialog with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and paste the following commands one by one:

    ```vscode
    ext install ms-python.isort
    ext install ms-python.black-formatter
    ```

4. Now create a folder called **.vscode** in the project folder. After, create a file called **settings.json** in it. Open it an paste the following:

    ```jsonc
    {
    // PYTHON
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-python.black-formatter",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
            "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
        },
    },
    "black-formatter.args": ["--line-length", "120"],
    "isort.args":["--profile", "black"],
    // END PYTHON
    }
    ```

> [!NOTE]  
> A `.vscode` folder with `settings.json` is already available in the project root. This step is only if you have your custom `settings.json` file.
> You can add more settings in it if you want. For more information, visit the [settings.json][settings.json-doc] section in the official documentation.

That's it! Now you can code with the Black and Isort formatter! Every time you save a python file (.py) in this project, the formatters will automatically format the code for you!

> [!NOTE]  
> The auto formatting will only do the job in the project folder (Workspace). If you want to auto format globally, you need to add the same content in the user settings.json. You can open it by open it the command palette with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> and enter **settings.json**. While typing it, you will see the **Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)** option. Select it and only paste the content between the two curly brackets in the file (those in the begin and the end of the file).
